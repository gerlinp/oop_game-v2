# Project 4: OOP Game Show App

browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." Uses Javascript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on a physical or an onscreen keyboard

## Changes to Styling

Changed background images to .win, .start, .lose, and body.

Added window class to overlay banner and onscreen keyboard for readability as they were blending in with background at some points.
